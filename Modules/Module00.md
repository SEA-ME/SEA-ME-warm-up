## Exercise 02 : Do you know string??

The first one is just for using string. 

- Make the program as follows this:

        2. To convert LOWER CASE
    2. Use string class’s functions
        1. substr, append, insert, replace, erase, etc..
    - The program gets two arguments:
        - ./convert {command} {string}
            - ex) `./convert up I’m the one!`
                - output:  `I’M THE ONE!`
            - ex) `./convert down I’m A SMall man`
                - output: `i’m a small man`
